# Successful Landing on the Far Side of the Moon                  
[Catching up with the information from the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46724727), at 10:26 Beijing time (02:26 GMT, 3rd Jan., 2019), the un-crewed Chang'e-4 probe touched down in the South Pole-Aitken Basin, state media said. It has been seen as a milestone in space exploration for China to land a robotic spacecraft on the far side of the Moon, the first ever such attempt and landing.                            
               
The Chang'e-4 probe has already sent back its first pictures from the surface, which were shared by state media. With no direct communication link possible, all pictures and data have to be bounced off a separate satellite before being relayed to Earth.

**Historical Background of the Moon Exploration**                  
There have been numerous missions to the Moon in recent years, but the vast majority have been to orbit, fly by or impact. The last crewed landing was Apollo 17 in 1972.                
                  
In this exploration, the Chang'e-4 probe is aiming to explore a place called the Von Kármán crater, located within the much larger South Pole-Aitken (SPA) Basin - thought to have been formed by a giant impact early in the Moon's history.                               
                        
**The Distinctiveness of this Landing**                    
This is the first time any craft has landed on the unexplored and rugged far side, which is not visible from the Earth due to "tidal locking". As Ye Quanzhi, an astronomer at Caltech, told the BBC, China had "attempted something that other space powers have not attempted before". The previous Moon missions have only landed on the Earth-facing side.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The near side (L) and far side (R) of the Moon have some key differences, credited to NASA                
              
The event responsible for carving out the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) Basin is thought to have been so powerful, it punched through the Moon's crust and down into the zone called the mantle.

I should admit that human's mind is one of the most attractive tourist spots for me to explore. But what disappoints me sometimes is that our brains (our basic operating systems) always have some inherent inferiorities. Though these inferiorities in current language context, may have helped us survive several times in our history of civilization, I still hate them and wish some innovative methods help transform these inferiorities into some positive fuel in my daily exploration.                      
                  
People tend to be more sensitive with the colorful and motional objects than those in monotonous color, more sensitive with vivid images than the characters though the story described by them is more vivid. This is one of the inferiorities in our brains if my judgement serves me right. because it forces us to get addicted to the coarse comedies, the soap shows with exaggerating and colorful fashion in actors/actresses, electronic games, and others that can induce the secretion of dopamine producing feelings of easy satisfaction and pleasure.

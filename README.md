We know that in the first week of this December, two bad news hit the tranquility of the media. According to news report, [Shoucheng Zhang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoucheng_Zhang), a great Chinese-American physicist and a successful investor, suicided at home in San Francisco on Dec.01, 2018, due to the severe torment from the depression. And coincidentally in the same date, [Wanzhou Meng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meng_Wanzhou), the chief financial officer of Huawei and daughter of the most successful Chinese telecommunication company's founder, was arrested in Canada at the behest of America for alleged violations of Iran sanctions.        
                 
Of course, sad and shocked for the bad news, our tiny planet lost a great physicist, an interesting soul, I know that some of my fellows in SYSU and the International Division of Theoretical Physics would suffered more from the emotional loss. Because                  
                             
                   
Yours,

# Parts of My Life in School of Physics, Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU)       
With extremely sensibility-oriented mannerism, I had to shape my thinking habits with the right mix of science and logic, otherwise I should have drown in emotion and my imagination. Thus my academic exploration in the International Division of Theoretical Physics in SYSU saved my life in some sense. I have gradually developed some techniques to schedule my emotion and balance the rationality and sensibility, both of which are the important elements of my 'base operating system', installed in my SYSU career. The first application of this base operating system was a full-time working career in Huawei Technologies in the past gap year, before going to the London School of Economics and Political Science for my master degree. This one-year career growed in the solid line connecting my undergraduate and postgraduate career just like a Y-axis added to the X-axis, another dimension for me to observe the X-axis, my studying career in the distance. On the eve of landing back to the X-axis, I need a letter for myself as some sense of ritual, to pigeonhole the past stories.                                              

---------------         

           
Five years have passed since I met my **Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU)**, my alma mater for the first time. The most magical but desperate thing is that time keeps on its pace constantly flying to distance. Recently my sister, Tsuiki, has started her new journey in Sun Yat-Sen University, with the similar curiosity about the future, which would also appear in my memory everytime when I restart my career in SYSU in my mind. This letter is being written for myself in some sense, as an emotional interface for self-talking, also a mechanical string to keep me in an appropriate distance from my memory, far enough for not being burn by the unstoppable emotion, but not too far to preserve my memory.                   

         
Yours,

Checking in for the flight to London    

--------------------         

SYSU is a tier-one university in China, located by the Zhujiang River in Guangzhou, rooted near the Canton Tower. Magically my SYSU, a fount of wisdom and a southern mecca for knowledge-cravers, could always maintain its unique and independent role in the hustle and bustle , just like an abrupt green blancket laying down in the centre of the prosperous city.

If you wanna taste the beauty, stay distant as a mere spectator. I gradually tend to agree with this (maybe the comfort for parting grief). Besides the overall beauty appreciation, only when you leave your alma mater for a while and work in actual scenarios, can you find that your alma mater has lived in your mind, molding your behaviors and your thinking framework. With my basic study in opto-electronics information science and engineering, I kept interested in Physics and started further exploration in **theoretical physics**, as a member of **the International Division of Theoretical Physics** afterwards. My happiest stage in my SYSU career came from this division, with talented classmates exploring in theoretical physics, led by world-class professors in mathematics and physics, like **John Iliopoulos (the winner of Dirac Medal), Tiberiu Harko (a senior expert in General Relativity and Cosmology), Kirk T McDonald (a great physician in Princeton University, with expertise in Elementary Particle Physics and Electromagnetism), and Zbiniew Domanski (majoring in mathematics, complex systems and nonlinear physics)**. My interest in mathematics was activated in a half year's academic journey with Prof. Domanski, to figure out some inconspicuous but certain laws in nature or market, using some quantization knowledge like the fractality, the random walk and other non-Markovian processes.              
            
All that beauty and four years' journey with the academic utopia, may forever stay merely in my memory. Meanwhile gradually I tend to be assimilated by the practicality, with my initial dream to be a content theoretical physicist fading away. But would it be a waste of your ever study in the initial major if you switch your major or change your profession? I think it wrong exactly and we should not merely equate the meaning of education with the absorbed visible knowledge. With the visible knowledge regarded as the application programmes installed in our brains, I guess the most important meaning of the education is its constribution to our base 'operating systems'. The thinking pattern of theoretical physics learning has determined my basic sense of world and nature. I always tend to develop a self-consistent and self-adaptive congnitive system in the process of solving a new problem or learning something new. I tend to be more interested in substraction rather than addition, like summing up a few principles and fulfilling and consolidating them constantly rather than adding new rules continuously related to different cases. Oriented by these principles, we maybe more sensitive to some elements like the beauty, the simple essence, the symmetry, the framework, the connection, the entanglement, the first-principle thinking, etc. We would go ahead by simplifying and modeling when confronted with some practical problems. Then the existing models (constructed based on some simple prinples, mentioned above) would help develop new stories in actual cases. If either the practicality or our logic inference go beyond our models, we need another round of creation and revision. We wish to live in such a closed loop, at least logically.                         
           

**I stick at something that would grow in my logical framework**： Operating in my closed loop, it is logically in current node to develop my own individual website to orient my exploration in computing, programming and writing. My website grows in English, which merely acts as a foreign tool in my learning structure in the past. But this summer vacation I begin attempting to relearn this foreign language, free of my mother tongue, only with the foreign language's self-iteration. Besides my writing on the past and future, life and working, I also share our progress in computing and programming. Because programming is like using a foreign language to make you understood by the computers. And currently the most romantic thing within my imagination is that I make myself understood by some of you. You may be strangers we have never met before, or my friends, or I looking back to this letter in the future.     

         
         
## Memorable Scenes_@Zhou Mr.Chuwei 
- As the reward for everyday's busy, I loved to have circles of jogging around the Zhujiang River. The night running witnessed the most beautiful nightscape in Guangzhou, refreshing my physical and mental perception. The eve running painted the transition between day and night, creating beauty from vague, with a decreasing frame number in my eye.

- Walking on the shady path, surrounded by a wide profusion of trees, I loved this individual leisure moment after a whole day's study and before going back to my dormitory, carrying the school bag containing a whole day's time and knowledge，thinking about some mathematics or physics problems like imagining another way to derive the covariant recurrence formula of Christoffel Symbol based on geometrical characteristics of covariant derivative, like the Black Hole Information Paradox, like the connection between the Hawking Temperature and the virtual time periodicity of Schwarzschild manifold and Temperature Green Function, etc.

Her inbreaking my life in black and white, like a colorful and little fat butterfly, had exceeded my expectation, which merely served under my inference. Only for something that could live in my logic analysis would I keep my expectation. But something like love and those misread as love would not grow as logical inference. Such a kind of appreciation for our getting together as an unexpected surprise to my college life, in spite of an inevitable terminal of our intersecting interval.

_She was specializing in twining, like suspending in the midair with double legs locking one of mine as one of our pictures above. If I  could have devoted more priority to her in my schedule, if I could have handled some problems more maturely rather than some childish behaviours at that time, some memorable scenarios in my ever virtual reality glasses might lasted extended time. But time would not reversed the arrow and her specialty would no longer belong to me once the 'lock' was opened._

_As a senior otaku(homeboy), I would not go outdoor before if it were not for a UK T4 Visa. After finishing my Visa application, I wandered around the Haixinsha Square and the Zhujiang Newtown, where she twined my arm for the first time when walking after her internship interview. We shared much time nearby, for some latest movies, for some newly opened restauarants, etc. I guess in some sense the meaning of couples maybe its refreshing something boring when doing singly._

_Coming across the K11 Shopping and Arts Center, I bought two mini books of Bob Dylan's lyrics, Love and Theft, Knockin' on Heaven's Door. As Steve Jobs has ever said in an interview, most of things in life could be interpreted in Bob Dylan's and The Beatles' lyrics. There's one line in one Beatles' song singing that you and I have memories longer than the road that stretches out ahead. Some time should be spent in repositioning some memories in my mind. Have I shouldered too much of the past? I think it a better way to transfer some emotion into the binary form storaged as bits online, as what I am writing on my website._

_ALong the central line beginning with the Canton Tower, the Sky Ring Square would extend the prosperity to the Sports West Road. When glancing at the airscape of the lighting city, you may find the hurrying people like a herd of sheep. You will encounter 29 million and 200 thousand people throughout your lifetime. "Some just pass by you on the street, some nod head with you, some once give you a hand but leave in a hurry, some interact with you, whom you can not even be reminded of their names. Only an extremely small part of people will leave a mark in your life, those who care about your basic necessities, becoming your families, those who share your sorrow and happiness, becoming your intimate friends, while those who gives mutual help and relief in each other's life, becoming your true love. As life goes on. And those people who walk along with you till the end, each of the 1/29200000, will cast the warmest reflection in your heart when you look backwards. And who will become your 1/29200000?"_

## My Career in International Division of Theoretical Physics 
Time and space tell the material how to move and the material tells the time and space how to bend. Our world-class professors tell us how to hear the rhythm of the nature and the voice of our deep mind.

Due to the limitation of luggages' weight, I could not carry all my books attached with me when moving to London. I could only write down some typical and simple examples here for preservation some of the past affections to theoretical physics. Everytime when I open series books like From Classical to Quantum Fields, A First Course in General Relativity, An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory, Advanced Quantum Mechanics, etc, I can still taste that invincible and indispensible experience in Physics, with symmetry, geometry, generators, representations, hermitian matrices, orthogonality normalization completeness and so on. Sometimes you would be excited at some magical news like the Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger, sometimes you would be down in spirits when locked by a simple problem. Some static and dispersed fragments of memory would become vivid and coherent when you arrange your thoughts with some familiar elements' activation.

傅里叶变换的思想基本常用，几乎每一门课程的开始都是以傅里叶变换作为基础，量子力学的表象变换，

I need some ending of the past as those people.  
我需要一些告别，和我的专业，和我在SYSU的时光，和我曾经相当一名伟大物理学家的梦想。
VR就像装了一个天眼在天上一样，往后余生，我只能飘着看自己的母校了，不再是剧中的角色。


人是很容易害怕和恐惧的。我想把一些东西记录下来，其实目的就是为了让自己知道，过去的经历，过去认识的那么多厉害的人，过去的所有资源，其实都在给予我们力量。不要害怕。终将有一天，我们也要成为那些能给予很多人力量的人。

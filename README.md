# Parts of my life in School of Physics, Sun Yat-Sen University           
           
Five years have passed since I met my **Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU)**, my alma mater for the first time. The most magical but desperate thing is that time keeps on its pace constantly flying to distance. Recently my best junior sister apprentice, Tsuiki, has started her new journey in Sun Yat-Sen University, with the similar curiosity about the future, which would also appear in my memory everytime when I restart my career in SYSU in my mind. This letter is being written for myself in some sense, as an emotional interface for self-talking, also a mechanical string to keep me in an appropriate distance from my memory, far enough for not being burn by the unstoppable emotion, but not too far to preserve my memory.

## Memorable Scenes 
As the praise for everyday's busy, I love to have a circle of jogging around the Zhujiang River. The night running witnessed the most beautiful nightscape in Guangzhou, refreshing my physical and mental perception. The eve running painted the 过渡 of between day and night, creating beauty from vague, with a decreasing frame number in your eye.    

The most memorable moment is that I walked in the 林荫小径 back to my domitory after studying for a whole day, 背着书包盛着我一天的知识和时光，thinking about some mathematics or physics problems like imagining another way to derive the covariant recurrence formula of Christoffel Symbol based on geometrical characteristics of 协变导数, like 毕业论文的一些知识。

## My career in International Division of Theoretical Physics 
傅里叶变换的思想基本常用，几乎每一门课程的开始都是以傅里叶变换作为基础，量子力学的表象变换，

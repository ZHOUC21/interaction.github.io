When studying a case in supply chain management, the well-informed pattern can be shown as:          
**'Products'**                              
- Basic products composition/features (vital components, manufacturing period, mainstream models, etc)               
- BOM (Bill of Materials), Relations (Parent-Son items, Substitution Relation) with different items in the BOM                
**'Organizations/People'**               
- Vendors collaboraton (procurement)

People always insist on some conventional wisdoms even they make no sense in many cases. One simple algabric conclusion held by the crowd is that if one guy get up one hour earlier each day, with one month's passing he/she would obtain the extra time of more than one day as payoff. But people may ignore some facts like if I sleep one-hour longer

# Chapter1_in London      

Almost one and a half months have passed since I landed in London. Study and working prospects have already become the theme before our settling down. 


Hopefully I can be an iron 'Olympian' mentally and physically. But as far as I'm concerned, the moment when a man seems the most powerful is not the time when he pretends to be strong, but those when he attempts to be weak and soft.  
I love writing, just like coding with time.

# Parts of My Life in School of Physics, Sun Yat-Sen University           
           
Five years have passed since I met my **Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU)**, my alma mater for the first time. The most magical but desperate thing is that time keeps on its pace constantly flying to distance. Recently my best junior sister apprentice, Tsuiki, has started her new journey in Sun Yat-Sen University, with the similar curiosity about the future, which would also appear in my memory everytime when I restart my career in SYSU in my mind. This letter is being written for myself in some sense, as an emotional interface for self-talking, also a mechanical string to keep me in an appropriate distance from my memory, far enough for not being burn by the unstoppable emotion, but not too far to preserve my memory.                   

         
Yours,

--------------------         

SYSU is a tier-one university in China, located by the Zhujiang River in Guangzhou, rooted near the Canton Tower. Magically my SYSU, a fount of wisdom and a southern mecca for knowledge-cravers, could always maintain its unique and independent role in the hustle and bustle , just like an abrupt green blancket laying down in the centre of the prosperous city.

If you wanna taste the beauty, stay distant as a mere spectator. I gradually tend to agree with this (maybe the comfort for parting grief). Besides the overall beauty appreciation, only when you leave your alma mater for a while and work in actual scenarios, can you find that your alma mater has lived in your mind, molding your behaviors and your thinking framework. With my basic study in opto-electronics information science and engineering, I kept interested in Physics and started further exploration in **theoretical physics**, as a member of **the International Division of Theoretical Physics** afterwards. My happiest stage in my SYSU career came from this division, with talented classmates exploring in theoretical physics, led by world-class professors in mathematics and physics, like **John Iliopoulos (the winner of Dirac Medal), Tiberiu Harko (a senior expert in General Relativity and Cosmology), Kirk T McDonald (a great physician in Princeton University, with expertise in Elementary Particle Physics and Electromagnetism), and Zbiniew Domanski (majoring in mathematics, complex systems and nonlinear physics)**. My interest in mathematics was activated in a half year's academic journey with Prof. Domanski, to figure out some inconspicuous but certain laws in nature or market, using some quantization knowledge like the fractality, the random walk and other non-Markovian processes.              
            
All that beauty and four years' journey with the academic utopia, may forever stay merely in my memory. Meanwhile gradually I tend to be assimilated by the practicality, with my initial dream to be a content theoretical physicist fading away. But would it be a waste of your ever study in the initial major if you switch your major or change your profession? I think it wrong exactly and we should not merely equate the meaning of education with the absorbed visible knowledge. With the visible knowledge regarded as the application programmes installed in our brains, I guess the most important meaning of the education is its constribution to our base 'operating systems'. The thinking pattern of theoretical physics learning has determined my basic sense of world and nature. I always tend to develop a self-consistent congnitive system in the process of solvign a new problem or learning something new. and care about the beauty, the simple essence, the symetry, the framework, the first-principle thinking, the connection, the entanglement. And I always force me to have a 一套自洽而圆融的价值体系. I care about the 模板 and modeling when confronted with some practical problems. That's one of the reasons why I develop my own individual website to orient my exploration in computing, programming and writing. In my past studying career, English acts just like a tool in my learning structure. But this summer vacation I begin attempting to 重新学习 this foreign language, 其实是想以外语作为媒介，用新的思路去思考. And programming is like using a foreign language to make you understood by the computers. 在学生时代，我们学习和运用外语的基本逻辑还是基于母语的思考，就像我们不会直接用二进制的语言和电脑交流一样。I tend to be more interested in substraction rather than addition, like summing up a few principles and fulfilling and   

         
         
## Memorable Scenes_@Zhou Mr.Chuwei 
As the reward for everyday's busy, I loved to have circles of jogging around the Zhujiang River. The night running witnessed the most beautiful nightscape in Guangzhou, refreshing my physical and mental perception. The eve running painted the transition between day and night, creating beauty from vague, with a decreasing frame number in my eye.    

The most memorable moment is that I walked in the 林荫小径 back to my domitory after studying for a whole day, 背着书包盛着我一天的知识和时光，thinking about some mathematics or physics problems like imagining another way to derive the covariant recurrence formula of Christoffel Symbol based on geometrical characteristics of 协变导数, like 毕业论文的一些知识。

## My career in International Division of Theoretical Physics 
傅里叶变换的思想基本常用，几乎每一门课程的开始都是以傅里叶变换作为基础，量子力学的表象变换，

I need some ending of the past as those people.  
我需要一些告别，和我的专业，和我在SYSU的时光，和我曾经相当一名伟大物理学家的梦想。
VR就像装了一个天眼在天上一样，往后余生，我只能飘着看自己的母校了，不再是剧中的角色。

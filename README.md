# Successful Landing on the Far Side of the Moon                  
[Catching up with the information from the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46724727), at 10:26 Beijing time (02:26 GMT, 3rd Jan., 2019), the un-crewed Chang'e-4 probe touched down in the South Pole-Aitken Basin, state media said. It has been seen as a milestone in space exploration for China to land a robotic spacecraft on the far side of the Moon, the first ever such attempt and landing.              

**Historical Background of the Moon Exploration**                  
There have been numerous missions to the Moon in recent years, but the vast majority have been to orbit, fly by or impact. The last crewed landing was Apollo 17 in 1972.

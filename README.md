# Before New Start           
           
Five years have passed since I met my Sun Yat-Sen University, my 母校 for the first time. The most magical but 令人绝望的 disappointing thing is that time keeps on its pace constantly flying to distance. Recently my best junior sister apprentice, 子怡, has started her new journey in Sun Yat-Sen University, with the similar curiosity about the future, which would also appear in my memory everytime when I restart my career in SYSU in my mind.

As the praise for everyday's 繁忙, I love to have a circle of jogging around the Zhujiang River. The night running witnessed the most beautiful 夜景 in Guangzhou, refreshing my physical and mental perception. The eve running painted the 过渡 of between day and night, creating beauty from vague, with a decreasing frame number in your eye.

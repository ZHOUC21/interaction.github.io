# Quick Winning_Chapter1_in London      

Almost one and a half months have passed since I landed in London. Study and working prospects have already become the theme before our settling down. Some transferable habits I gained from Huawei Technologies helped categorize my life, like quick winning and iterating, information management, etc.           
          
          

I tend to make myself understood briefly, rather than 100%-description in some previous letters. Glancing at some memorable scenarios in the past month, can help refresh my daily life state, like a non-Markovian process. Taking the time sequence:

Hopefully I can be an iron 'Olympian' mentally and physically. But as far as I'm concerned, the moment when a man seems the most powerful is not the time when he pretends to be strong, but those when he start attempting to be weak and soft.  
I love writing, just like coding with time. Life's like a binary tree, keep growing and experiencing.

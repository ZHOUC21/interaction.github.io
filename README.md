I should admit that human's mind is one of the most attractive tourist spots for me to explore. But what disappoints me sometimes is that our brains (our basic operating systems) always have some inherent inferiorities. Though these inferiorities in current language context, may have helped us survive several times in our history of civilization, I still hate them and wish some innovative methods help transform these inferiorities into some positive fuel in my daily exploration.                





Yours,

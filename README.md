# Pre-Hogmanayï¼š Wish to Categorize My Life in a Better Way                  
I should admit that human's mind is one of the most attractive tourist spots for me to explore. But what disappoints me sometimes is that our brains (our basic operating systems) always have some inherent inferiorities. Though these inferiorities in current language context, may have helped us survive several times in our history of civilization, I still hate them and wish some innovative methods help transform these inferiorities into some positive fuel in my daily exploration.                      
                  
People tend to be more sensitive with the colorful and motional objects than those in monotonous color, more sensitive with vivid images than the characters though the story described by them is more vivid. This is one of the inferiorities in our brains if my judgement serves me right. Because it forces us to get addicted to the coarse comedies, the soap shows with exaggerating and colorful fashion in actors/actresses, electronic games, and others that can induce the secretion of dopamine producing feelings of easy satisfaction and pleasure.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  A famous TV cooking show in Hongkong, which often shares my dinner time              
                         
                         
Though I have blamed myself for several times, I still tend to kill my time with some online shows unintentionally, with some easy happiness as payoffs. It seems that there still exists a long journey that stretches out ahead for me to reach my preinstalled state, in which I look like a neutral and transparent container of all the stories or phenomenons hitting my every single day, in which I give infinitesimal emotional reaction to the 'noises' in my life, in which I donnot need some different days in different cities or countries to refresh myself, to digest my feeling of boredom. I always fuel my own ambitions to accelerate the progress in this special journey, in spite of different types of sacrifice for balance. I hate everything I have got familiar with, which made my life more static. But the feeling of boredom is also an inevitable result of the evolution, because the feeling of boredom is a lateral reflection of our learning ability.                   
                  
It seems not that easy to do the right things. Because various inherent characteristics (exemplified above) would drag us back to the large group of people, enjoying the direct and easy happiness together, getting emotional resonance with fictitious products/applications online. I respect these groupments and even encourage most of us to live in these ways. But I have gradually realized that I have choosed another option, to stay in a more rational box observing the past and future. This box would be destined for being attacked because the total development of science and business tends to create more convenience and comfortable sensations for human beings, based on our human nature. Hence if you wish to keep living in the box, you should learn how to overcome the social inertia.                 
                 
Despite it seems deceiving myself within my imagination, I can always feel some types of inconspicuous but powerful missions orientating a special prospect for me. One basic rule is to categorize the daily life, even though it sounds monotonous. The main variable we use for classification is the 'time'. The **main usages of the time** can be divided into three categories, **maintaining class**, **investing class (study)** and **producing class (problem-solving)**. Some other parts like some 'noise' (like those in which you have to stand at the intersection and wait for the traffic light to turn green) are also included in our timetable. I wish to construct an ensemble connecting every single frag, like all the leaves growing in different branches of one tree. Another basic rule is to keep yourself exposed to various challenges, feed yourself emotionally with problem-solving.The third basic rule is to remember the former two simple rules and practice and practice again.                                    
                                                                         
All the assignments have the same convergence, expressing yourself. We explore in machine learning, operations research & analytics, appreciate literatures, visit musuems walking along the gallery, fall in love with some classic types of Gothic architecture and even fall in love with her/him, etc. All these stuff serve for the same function, expressing yourself. Because except self-expressing, we can do nothing. And the orientation by describing yourself is to find yourself, like I mentioned previously in [one of my pages](https://www.zhouchuwei.com/life.github.io/). But firstly you should feed yourself and allow it to grow into different states, and you still need some techniques to analyse and describe yourself, that's why we should keep studying and arrange our life in a better way.

# Pre-Hogmanayï¼š Wish to Categorize My Life in a Better Way                  
I should admit that human's mind is one of the most attractive tourist spots for me to explore. But what disappoints me sometimes is that our brains (our basic operating systems) always have some inherent inferiorities. Though these inferiorities in current language context, may have helped us survive several times in our history of civilization, I still hate them and wish some innovative methods help transform these inferiorities into some positive fuel in my daily exploration.                      
                  
People tend to be more sensitive with the colorful and motional objects than those in monotonous color, more sensitive with vivid images than the characters though the story described by them is more vivid. This is one of the inferiorities in our brains if my judgement serves me right. because it forces us to get addicted to the coarse comedies, the soap shows with exaggerating and colorful fashion in actors/actresses, electronic games, and others that can induce the secretion of dopamine producing feelings of easy satisfaction and pleasure.

Though I have blamed myself for several times, I still tend to kill my time with some online shows unintentionally, with some easy happiness as payoffs. It seems that there still exists a long journey that stretches out ahead for me reach my preinstalled state, in which I looks like a neutral and transparent container of all the stories or phenomenons hitting reaching my every single day, in which I give infinitesimally insignificant emotional reaction to the 'noises' in my life, in which I donnot need some different days in different cities or countries to refresh myself, to digest my feeling of boredom. I always fuel my own ambitions to accelerate the progress in this special journey, in spite of different types of sacrifice for balance. I hate everything I have got familiar with, which made my life more static. But the feeling of boredom is also an inevitable result of the evolution, because the feeling of boredom is a lateral reflection of our learning ability.                   
                  
It seems not that easy to do the right things. Because various inherent characteristics (exemplified above) would drag us back to the large group of people, enjoying the direct and easy happiness together, getting emotional resonance with fictitious products/applications online. I respect these groupments and even encourage most of us to live in these ways. But I have gradually realized that I have choosed another option, to stay in a more rational box observing the past and future. This box would be destined for being attacked because the total development of science and business tends to create more convenience and comfortable sensations for human beings, based on our human nature. Hence if you wish to keep living in the box, you should learn how to overcome the social inertia.                 
                 
Despite it seems deceiving myself within my imagination, I can always feel some types of inconspicuous but powerful missions orientating a special prospect for me.

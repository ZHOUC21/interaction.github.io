# Supply Chain Case Study_Meditech Surgical                                      
When studying a case in supply chain management, the well-informed pattern can be shown as:          
**'Products'**                              
- Basic products composition/features (vital components, manufacturing period, mainstream models, etc)               
- BOM (Bill of Materials), Relations (Parent-Son items, Substitution Relation) with different items in the BOM                

**'Organizations/People'**               
- Vendors collaboraton (procurement)                
- Planners synchronization (completeness of manufacturing materials)                 
- Contract coordinators adjustments (front-line interaction with clients)                  

**'Business Thinking'**              
- Planning/Management Strategies           
- Integrated Product Development and Lifecycle Management of Products             
- The Entire Industry Development and Ecology
